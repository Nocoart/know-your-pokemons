# Welcome to my little Pokemon Journey.

## This is a little game written in Typescript React.

In this game your goal is to catch as much pokemon as possible, it makes you level up (how original ðŸ¤“).
There is two pages :
- To go to the pokedex, click on the pokedex on the left.
- To go to the map and start catching pokemons click on the pokeball.

Depending on the region you choose on the map, a random set of pokemon will appear, if your level is too far from the pokemon level you'll not be able to catch it.

Change area on the map to get a new set of pokemons.
To catch a pokemon you must enter its exact name in the input field then click the pokeball.

Happy hunting ðŸ˜Š





### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
